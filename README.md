# TinDog: Tinder for Dogs

## üìñ About The Project

Lack of socialization is a known cause of behavioral issues in dogs, such as anxiety and aggression. This is a common problem for owners in urban areas and for dogs acquired during the pandemic. TinDog provides a fun and easy way for owners to find suitable playmates for their pets in a controlled environment.
